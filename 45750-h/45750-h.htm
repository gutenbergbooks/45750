<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Probably</span> the most important of the South
American republics, Brazil has now won for herself
world recognition and esteem. Though Costa
Rica, Cuba, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua,
and Panama made formal declarations of
war against the German Empire, Brazil alone was
able to offer material service. Each brave ally
offered her all to the cause of freedom, from the
great navy and army, the brains, brawn, and resources
of the British Empire, to the little army
of three hundred men from the tiny principality
of thirty-eight square miles, San Marino. Brazil's
offering was her splendid navy, which did signal
patrol service and was a valued reserve.</p>

<p>We can be certain that two great nations, large
and small brothers of the Western Hemisphere,
the United States and Brazil, brought together in
the fellowship of such a great cause, will ever
show their mutual admiration, and keep bright
their friendship.</p>

<h2>Preface</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> Little Brazilian Cousin lives in a land
not so well known as the countries of Europe
and Asia, but one of great natural beauty and
charm.</p>

<p>Through it flows the greatest river of the
world, the Amazon, whose banks are covered
with rich tropical vegetation, most beautiful to
behold. Its forests are full of birds of brilliant
plumage and strange animals, while the Indians,
who were once the only people here, are not yet
all civilized.</p>

<p>The Little Brazilian Cousins are nearly all
descended from the Portuguese who came to
this land, and made it their own, before it finally
became a republic like the United States. They
built many great cities, and have cultivated the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
country so that now it is becoming rich and
powerful.</p>

<p>With such a beautiful home, and with such
advantages, our Little Brazilian Cousin will
soon become one of the most important of all
the little cousins, as he is now one of the most
picturesque and interesting.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
<small>A QUIET SIESTA</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Affonzo</span> was tired of talking to the white
cockatoo. It was the time of day when his little
sister Lola took her siesta, and he had no
one to play with. He was himself such a big
boy, soon eleven years old, that he felt no
longer the need of the daily siesta, although
in the warm country of Brazil where he lived,
even grown people like a nap in the middle of
the day.</p>

<p>Affonzo himself did not feel very lively. The
sun beat down like a great ball of fire and only
the cool veranda or the shady garden seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
enticing. The garden should have been pleasant
enough to satisfy any boy, for it was a vision
of tropic beauty. Tall palms waved their
feathery branches heavenward, and gaily coloured
flowers flaunted their gorgeous petals
while brilliant birds flittered hither and yon.</p>

<p>But Affonzo was used to all this beauty, and
he wanted something new to do, for this little
Brazilian cousin was very like his American ones
and could not be quiet very long. Even the
fruit garden seemed tiresome. Generally he was
glad to spend his time there, for the huge banana
trees which grew in a banana patch at the end
of the house were sure of several visits from
him during the day. The plants were twice as
tall as he, and the fruit grew in great bunches,
many of them weighing fifty pounds, and Affonzo
always chose the finest for himself
and Lola to eat. Besides these there were figs,
pineapples, mangoes, grapes and oranges all
of which grow in Brazil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>The American watermelon also had been
planted and the Senhor was watching eagerly
to see if it would bear fruit, for he had been
told that in other parts of Brazil it grew rapidly
and bore well. Affonzo was much interested in
it too, for his cousin in the States had sent the
seeds and told him how delicious the fruit was.</p>

<p>He strolled toward the sunny slope where the
vines were tended by Joachim, the black who
took care of the garden and helped about the
house. Joachim's mother had nursed Affonzo's
mother in the days when there were black slaves
in Brazil, and he was devoted to the whole
family. He was just like a faithful black dog
watching the place, and was especially fond of
the children. He could cook and bake, wait on
the Senhor, tend the garden or the horses, and
could always be trusted to take care of little
Lola who was his great friend.</p>

<p>Affonzo looked at the green melon and wondered
how it tasted. He had heard so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
about it that he was very curious and could
hardly wait until the day came when it should be
served, for his mother had promised that each
should have a taste.</p>

<p>Above the melon vines grew one of the tallest
of the banana trees, and the fruit seemed to
Affonzo to be finer at that particular time than
he had ever seen it. He was very hungry and
felt he must have one of those bananas at once.
Ordinarily he would have climbed the tree like
a little monkey and helped himself, but his
mother had excused him from his siesta on condition
that he be quiet, and though he looked longingly
at the fruit he did not start to climb. He
threw himself down upon the grass and looked
up through the thick foliage at the blue above.</p>

<p>"I wish something would happen," he said
to himself. "It seems to me that nothing ever
happens. One half the year I must be in Para
and stay at my grandfather's to go to the Laure
Sodré Institute&mdash;I am tired of the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
name!&mdash;and the other half I must stay here
at the Fazenda with no playmate but Lola, and
she is made to sleep half the day. I wish something
would happen," and he sighed discontentedly.
"How hungry I am," he thought.
"I must have one of those bananas, they never
looked so good! I believe mamma will not care
if I climb for one, for she only said I must keep
quiet and I'm sure I'll make no noise." With
that the boy rose to his feet, and with a quick
glance around, he began to climb and was soon
squirming around the trunk of the tree like a
snake. Once there he reached for the best
bananas and filled the pockets of his linen suit
with them. He was just starting down when he
heard voices coming and peering cautiously down
the garden path he saw his father with an uncle
of whom he was very fond, and whom he had
not seen for some time.</p>

<p>"Uncle Prudente," he thought. "I wonder
when he came from Para and how long he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
going to stay. Oh, dear! how will I get down
from here?" Affonzo knew that his father
would not be likely to pass over any disobedience
and that he would be punished if he came down
at that moment. So he crouched among the
leaves and was still as a mouse while the two
gentlemen came directly under the banana tree
and stopped to talk.</p>

<p>"This is the American melon," said the
Senhor. "It will be ripe in another week.
There are others ripening but this is the finest.
If it is good I shall keep all the seeds and have
a large crop next year. If Juan comes, I shall
ask him to bring me the seeds of various kinds,
for there is nothing like variety in a garden. In
our hot climate these should do well and they
are very agreeable when properly cooled. I hope
Juan will come; a long visit from him would be
a good thing for Affonzo, who is growing
spoiled from being the only boy. He is wilful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and high-spirited but on the whole he is&mdash;what
is that?"</p>

<p>The Senhor stopped suddenly and Affonzo
never knew what he himself was, besides being
wilful and high spirited. Distressed at being a
listener, he had leaned too far out on the branch
on which he sat and it broke under his weight.
He gave a wild clutch and fell down, down,
down. He thought he would never stop, and oh,
horror! when he did light, it was astride the
shoulders of his uncle. Affonzo was a sturdy
little fellow and his uncle was slight and small,
the result being that both went down in a heap
on top of the melon.</p>

<p>For a moment no one spoke; then his father
pulled him off his uncle and helped his irate
brother to his feet. Uncle Prudente's white
linen suit was splashed from head to foot with
watermelon juice, his panama hat was crushed
out of shape, watermelon juice ran down his
face and several black seeds stuck to his face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
He was speechless with rage, but he looked so
very funny that Affonzo, sore and bruised by
his fall and terribly frightened, could not help
laughing. He sat down upon the ground and
laughed till he cried, and the noise woke all the
parrots dozing in the trees, and all began jabbering
at once, while the cockatoo gave one of his
terrible screeches.</p>

<p>When the noise had subsided a little, Senhor
Dias said sternly to Affonzo, "What is the
meaning of this?" Affonzo was silent, but he
quickly sprang to his feet and stood respectfully
in front of his father, for Brazilian boys are
taught to treat their elders with great deference.</p>

<p>"What were you doing in that tree?" demanded
his father.</p>

<p>"Eating bananas," said Affonzo simply.</p>

<p>"Does your mother permit that?" asked the
Senhor, for in Brazil, as in most South American
countries, the mother arranges all matters in
regard to the children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>"My mother allows me to climb trees and
eat bananas," said Affonzo. "That was not a
disobedience, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what?" demanded his father.</p>

<p>"But," continued Affonzo slowly. "She had
at the hour of the siesta requested me to keep
quiet."</p>

<p>"Do you call this quiet?" asked his father
sternly though his eyes twinkled. "Such a
noise has not been heard at the Fazenda for
many days."</p>

<p>"Not very quiet," said Affonzo, his head
drooping, though he could scarce keep from
laughing again. "I ask your pardon, my uncle,"
he added. "I intended nothing of disrespect.
I did but lose my hold upon the tree and the
next thing I knew I sat astride of your august
shoulders. I pray you pardon me." Affonzo's
tone was contrite, and his dancing eyes were on
the ground.</p>

<p>"Say no more of it," said his uncle, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
laid his hand on the boy's head. "Boys will be
boys and Affonzo is not unlike others. But next
time I come do not receive me with such a fierce
embrace. Indeed I thought my neck was broken
with the warmth of your welcome."</p>

<p>Affonzo's laugh rang out gaily, but he sobered
down when his father said, "I excuse you since
your uncle asks it, but remember after this that
the commands of your mother are to be obeyed.
Go now with your uncle and attend to his wants
while he repairs the damage your carelessness
has wrought."</p>

<p>Affonzo bowed to his father and made the
military salute as all school boys are taught to
do in Brazil, but he sighed to himself as he went,
"I wonder what he meant about Juan but I am
afraid to ask. And the worst of it all is, that
now I shall never know how the American melon
tasted."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
<small>IN THE FOREST</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sun was just rising and its slanting rays
cast a golden glow over the thick foliage when
Affonzo sprang out of bed next morning,
awakened by the noisy chattering of the birds.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" he exclaimed. "It is a fine day!
How glad I am, for now I can go hunting with
my father and Uncle Prudente."</p>

<p>He hurried into his clothes and down to the
breakfast-room, where Joachim was serving
strong black coffee, rolls and fruit to his father
and uncle.</p>

<p>"Here you are, bright and early," said the
Senhor. "Do you want to go with us? Perhaps
you would better not!"</p>

<p>Affonzo's face fell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, father! last night you promised!" he
said, and his father answered, "Oh, you may
go. I merely thought perhaps it might tire you
too much, for we shall have a long tramp."</p>

<p>"We must start at once," said his uncle, "if
we are to have any sport before midday," and
they started toward the forest.</p>

<p>The Fazenda of the Senhor Dias was situated
on the edge of the magnificent woods which
line the banks of the Amazon near the City of
Para.</p>

<p>"No wonder that this region around Para
is called the Paradise of Brazil," said the
Senhor as they entered the forest, where heavy
dew glittered on the leaves like diamonds in an
emerald crown. "Every time I enter the forest
it seems to me more splendid than it did the last
time."</p>

<p>"What are those huge trees?" asked Affonzo.</p>

<p>"You ought to know those, for they are
among the most famous of all Brazilian trees.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
They are the Stanba or stone wood, and beside
them grows a cinnamon tree. In addition to
these there is the jacaranda, pas d' arc, the
euphorbia, the large lofty cotton-wood tree, the
tall white syringa."</p>

<p>"I know that one," said Affonzo. "It is a
rubber tree. Won't you take me to see the rubber
gathered to-day?"</p>

<p>"Not to-day, but to-morrow, perhaps, for
your uncle wishes to make the rounds and you
may go with him."</p>

<p>"Thank you, that will be delightful," said
Affonzo.</p>

<p>Their path led through the forest where long
racemes of tropic moss hung down and waved
in the breeze, while fern and vines grew in a
tangle across the narrow path. Often the undergrowth
was so thick, that Joachim had to go
before the party and cut it away with his
<i>tracado</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>
<p>"You must keep silent now," said the Senhor.</p>

<p>"We shall frighten the game away if we talk.
Ah!" As he spoke he raised his gun to his
shoulder and fired. There was a shrill cry, a
flash of red and green wings, and a large bird
with an enormous bill fluttered to the ground
before them.</p>

<p>"A toucan!" cried Affonzo, as Joachim
quickly bagged the bird. "Isn't it queer that
the bird's cry sounded just like its name,
<i>Toucano! Toucano!</i>"</p>

<p>"That is just the reason that the Indians
named them <i>toucano</i>," said the Senhor. "But
listen, I hear monkeys."</p>

<p>Looking carefully about, the hunters saw two
monkeys at the top of a high tree, about which
clung a monkey's ladder, an enormous vine
which wound around the tree from its roots to
its very topmost branches. When the little
animals saw that they were perceived, they tried
to conceal themselves behind the huge leaves of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the tree, and the Senhor's shot showed no result
beyond an increased chattering.</p>

<p>"It seems a shame to kill such cunning little
creatures," said Affonzo, but his father said,</p>

<p>"We hunt for food, not for mere sport, my
son. Monkeys make an excellent dinner, and
you will be glad enough to eat after we have
tramped all morning through the heat."</p>

<p>"Master will not hit the monkeys," said
Joachim. "I will get them," and he quickly
stripped off all his clothing, except his cotton
trousers, and began to climb the monkey ladder.</p>

<p>It was not easy to climb with his gun in one
hand but he was careful and as nimble as a cat,
and he soon neared the top of the tree. He
perched in a crotch of the tree, which branched
out thickly at the top, and hiding behind some
leaves he waited until he could get a glimpse of
the monkeys. At last he spied one of them at
the end of a branch and firing quickly, the
monkey fell to the ground, fifty feet below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Joachim climbed down after it and the party
soon went its way through the forest. Now the
Senhor shot, and then his brother, and the boy
himself was allowed to fire at an ocelot which
crept through the bushes, and great was his delight
when he shot it.</p>

<p>As the noon hour approached, the sun rose
high in the heavens, and the heat grew so intense
that the Senhor said,</p>

<p>"We will go no farther. Let us rest and eat
until it grows cooler. Joachim, lead us to a
shady spot where we may camp."</p>

<p>"Yes, Senhor," said the black, and soon he
brought them to a ruined building of stone,
covered with vines and hidden among the trees.
Here upon the stone floor of the ruin, he kindled
a fire and cooked the monkey, the flesh of which
was simply delicious, and Affonzo ate until he
was so sleepy that he could not keep his eyes
open.</p>

<p>"What was this building?" he asked his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
father. "I did not know anyone had ever lived
here."</p>

<p>"No one knows what it was," replied his
father. "It has been here for years and the
Indians say it was built many, many years ago
by a Black Gown, as they called the early missionaries.
It may have been the beginning of a
mission house, but in any case it makes a very
nice cool place in which to take our siesta now.
So sleep, my son, and wake refreshed."</p>

<p>Affonzo closed his eyes and was soon in dreamland.
He slept long but had strange dreams of
some one's putting a heavy stone upon his chest
and pressing it down. At last he awoke with the
pressure still on him. He lay quite still, drowsily
wondering what was the matter with him and
before he stirred, Joachim's voice said in a
hoarse whisper,</p>

<p>"Don't move, little master, don't even open
your eyes!"</p>

<p>Affonzo had been trained to habits of strictest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
obedience, and he lay perfectly still without
moving a muscle, although wondering very much
what was the matter. He heard Joachim dart
quickly to his side. There was the sound of a
blow, and a loud exclamation from his father,
and Joachim said,</p>

<p>"Jump up, there is no danger now!"</p>

<p>As Affonzo sprang to his feet, the weight
rolled off his chest, and he saw the body of a
large snake pinned to the earth by the blade of
Joachim's trocado. It was a <i>jararaca</i>, a Brazilian
snake about six feet long, of a yellowish colour.
Sleeping in the cool of the old stone ruin it had
been disturbed by the intruders, and had crawled
across Affonzo's body to reach the door.</p>

<p>"My boy, you have Joachim to thank for
saving your life," said his father warmly, as he
put his arm around his boy and drew him to his
side. "The <i>jararaca</i> is very poisonous, and had
your awakening disturbed him, he might have
driven his fangs into you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good old Joachim," said Affonzo, as he
threw his arms around the black's neck. Negro
servants in Brazil who have been in a family for
years are always much beloved, and Affonzo was
devoted to the old negro. Joachim didn't say
much, but smiled at the boy as he took the dead
body of the snake outside, and prepared to take
off its beautiful skin.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
<small>A TROPICAL STORM</small></h2>


<p>"What fortunes could be made in these
forests," said the Senhor Dias to his brother,
"if people with capital only knew of the riches
stored here. Mahogany, satinwood, rosewood
and many other kinds of trees grow here in the
greatest abundance, and were there railroads
and ships to transport them, Brazil would be
one of the richest countries in the world."</p>

<p>"We should try to develop our own land,"
said his brother, and the two men entered into a
long conversation as to the wonderful forests of
the country, to which Affonzo listened with
interest.</p>

<p>"Oh, father!" he exclaimed, at last. "When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
you go up the river to see the forests may I go
with you?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps, but I could not make a promise
without first asking your mother's consent. The
trip will be an interesting one, but very hard,
though it might do you good."</p>

<p>"I should love to go," said Affonzo, and his
uncle added, "He will grow up a milksop if you
keep him in the nursery much longer; let him
go."</p>

<p>"It is about time we were starting now," said
the Senhor. "Joachim, make ready the bag.
Your uncle and I will walk on a little ahead,
Affonzo, and you can follow with Joachim. But
do not stray away from him, or you will miss the
path, and all manner of dangers lurk in these
forests."</p>

<p>Affonzo sat lazily waiting and watching as the
black put up the dinner things. "Take care of
my snake skin," he said, and Joachim smiled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and replied, "That will make a fine belt for the
little master when it is dried."</p>

<p>"I should like that very much," said Affonzo.
"You must make it for me."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Joachim as he swung over his
strong shoulders the wicker-work hamper and
game bag. "Is the young master ready to
go?"</p>

<p>"I am," Affonzo replied, and the two started
down the narrow path along which the Senhor
had disappeared.</p>

<p>"What kind of a tree is that?" asked Affonzo
pointing to a tall tree a hundred feet high.</p>

<p>"That is the <i>castanhao</i>," said Joachim.
"Some people call it the Brazil nut, and I have
often gathered nuts from it for you to eat. The
nuts grow at the very top of the tree in shells like
cocoanuts, and each shell has fifteen or twenty
nuts in it. Often I have thought my head was
broken when a shell fell upon it."</p>

<p>"I wonder why we don't catch up with my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
father?" said Affonzo. "Joachim, what makes
it so dark?"</p>

<p>"Storm coming. We must hurry," was the
brief answer.</p>

<p>Heavy clouds had gathered quickly; not a
glimmer of sunlight came through the trees, and
great drops of rain began to fall.</p>

<p>"Father!" cried Affonzo, but there was no
answer. "Father!" he called again and
Joachim shouted, "Senhor! Senhor!"</p>

<p>Nothing was heard but the screaming of the
wind, and the rain fell faster and faster. Vivid
flashes of lightning illuminated the forest, and
the thunder muttered and grumbled in the distance.</p>

<p>"Come with me quickly," said Joachim, as he
seized the boy by the hand. "We mustn't stay
here."</p>

<p>"But my father," cried Affonzo and tried to
get away from Joachim, but the negro held tight
to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Senhor can take care of himself; I must
take care of you," he said, as he pulled the boy
into a side path which led through the woods.
They made their way with difficulty through
the dense tangle of underbrush and vines. Often
a swinging branch would strike Affonzo on the
face, or he would tangle his feet in a swaying
vine and fall full length in a bed of fern. The
rain poured down in torrents, but the leaves and
interlaced branches served as a shield from the
great drops which pelted down like bullets.
Soon they came to a small hut with a thatched
roof and no door to bar the entrance. Into it
Joachim pulled the boy with scant ceremony.
As they entered the hut a man rose hurriedly
from his grass couch, and Affonzo recognized
an Indian who had often been to the Fazenda to
see his father.</p>

<p>"Ah, Vicente," said Joachim. "Give us
shelter."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>"Welcome," said the <i>syringuero</i>.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> "The
storm is bad. You reached shelter just in time.
See!"</p>

<p>He pointed through the door-way and
Affonzo saw that the streams of water were
well-nigh rivers, and the thunder and lightning
were almost incessant.</p>

<p>"Where do you suppose my father is?" he
asked, and Joachim answered,</p>

<p>"The Senhor has found shelter, do not fear;
and he will know you are safe with me."</p>

<p>"There is nothing to do but sit still, I suppose,"
said Affonzo, rather mournfully, for that
was the hardest thing in all the world for him to
do.</p>

<p>Vicente gave him a slow smile. He was an
old Indian of wiry frame, with keen black eyes.
His hair was straight and black, his chin firm and
strong, his features clean-cut, his face proud and
intelligent. He was in great contrast to curly-haired,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
black Joachim with his good-humoured,
stolid face.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 351px;">
<img src="images/i0044.jpg" width="351" height="500" alt="people on raft" />
<div class="caption">"HE PLACED HIMSELF ON A RAFT AND WAS ROWED TO
THE MIDDLE OF THE GREAT RIVER."</div>
</div>

<p>Vicente was one of the Indians whose fathers
had owned the land before the Portuguese discovered
it and named it Brazil from the red
colour of its dye woods. He gathered rubber
from the great trees which grew in the forest,
and lived alone in his little hut. He sat smoking
and watching the boy who looked out into the
rain feeling very miserable.</p>

<p>"Vicente," he said at last, "have you lived
long in the forest?"</p>

<p>"Many years have I been here," said the old
man. "And my fathers were here before me.
They hunted and fished and were chiefs in the
land until the white men came. Many died,
many went to the great hills, but I stayed here,
for the home of my fathers is my home."</p>

<p>"Tell me a story, Vicente," begged the little
boy.</p>

<p>"In the days of my fathers," said Vicente,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
"and of my father's fathers and their fathers,
things were not as to-day they are in the country
of the great river. There were no white
Senhores. The Indians dwelt alone. They
roamed the forests hunting with the bow and
arrow; they fished in the great stream; they
dwelt in their lodges and were happy.</p>

<p>"Often there were fights with other Indians
and these were of great glory. But my people
were peaceful and loved not war, never fighting
if they could first have peace. To secure peace
for our village, each year they made a sacrifice
and this was the manner of it.</p>

<p>"A chief smeared his body with gum and then
powdered himself with gold dust. He powdered
it all over, for in our mountains was much gold
and precious gems. He placed himself on a raft
and was rowed to the middle of the great river.
There he raised his hands to heaven, praying the
Great Spirit to save his village, and jumping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
into the water he washed off the precious dust.
This he sacrificed for his village.</p>

<p>"This was done each year and should have
been done still, when, perhaps, the Indian villages
would not have been destroyed and deserted,
but it ceased for the sin of one man. A
chief loved gold. That is an evil and a foolishness,
for gold is but for use and not for love.
He loved its glitter, and it seemed to him stupid
to waste it in a sacrifice.</p>

<p>"It was his turn to make the river sacrifice and
become the Gilded Man.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> But he was angry
within himself, and said, 'why shall I do this
thing? If the village wishes gold, why must
it take mine? It is a foolish thing!'</p>

<p>"Yet he could not refuse the sacrifice, for to
be the Gilded Man was thought an honour, and
did he refuse, many would suspect him of faithlessness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
to his tribe. So he gilded himself as
was the custom, and his brother chiefs rowed
him to the river and he raised his hands to
heaven.</p>

<p>"'Spirits of Rain and Wind, of Fire and
Water, of Good and Evil, keep our village and
our people,' he cried. 'We offer all to thee!'
Then he plunged into the stream and washed the
gold from his arms and legs. All the time his
heart was hot within him and he thought to himself,
'How my soul grieves to see this waste of
the beautiful, shining dust!' Then an evil spirit
tempted him and he did not wash off all the gold.
He left beneath his arms where others could not
see it, some of the glittering dust, and returned
to his village, an insult to the Spirits of Heaven.</p>

<p>"That night came fierce rain and wind and
with it a horde of enemies who descended like
a hurricane and destroyed the village,&mdash;men,
women and children. So the chief with all his
gold was destroyed utterly and he was the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Gilded Man. Thus were the Spirits of Heaven
avenged!"</p>

<p>"Thank you, Vicente," cried Affonzo. "That
is a good story. But see, the rain is over. Now
we must hurry to find my father," pointing as
he spoke to the doorway. The sky was clear and
bright, already rose-tinted with the rays of the
setting sun, low in the heavens.</p>

<p>"You must not go yet," said Vicente.
"Ground too wet, trees wet, bad for white people.
You must wait."</p>

<p>"But I must find my father," persisted
Affonzo, who, though he was a brave boy, began
to be somewhat frightened. But Vicente
knew the danger of the steaming forest with its
snakes, mosquitoes and insects swarming after
the storm. "Not safe to go now," he said, and
Joachim, who was quite comfortable where he
was, said, "Little master must sleep here and
go home in the morning."</p>

<p>"You shall have a good supper," said Vicente,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
who began at once to prepare the meal, and
Affonzo was forced to submit. So he watched
with interest the preparations for supper, for
like most boys, he was generally hungry. Vicente
built a fire in the stone fireplace in front of his
hut, and from a stone jar in the corner he
brought pork, some coarse bread, wild honey
found in the woods, and bananas.</p>

<p>"Take a bird from our bag," said Affonzo,
wishing to give his share of the feast, and
Joachim brought out a parrot which was soon
stewing in the pot with the pork, and a handful
of peppers and herbs. When the savoury stew
was done, the meal was spread upon a rough
bench at the door, and the three odd companions
sat down together.</p>

<p>"Quite a festive party," said a laughing voice,
and jumping up, Affonzo saw his father and
uncle approaching through the trees.</p>

<p>"Oh, papa, how glad I am to see you! I
feared you would be wet through, but you must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
have found shelter as we did, for you are
scarcely wet at all."</p>

<p>"I worried about you, more than you did
about me, I fancy," said his father, "though I
hoped Joachim would bring you here. Your
uncle and I missed the path some way, and could
not find you or the old house again, so we took
refuge in a deserted hut."</p>

<p>"The Senhors will sup with me," said Vicente,
"and remain here for the night since the forest
is unsafe for the boy."</p>

<p>"A thousand thanks; we will stay if you can
arrange for so many," was the reply, and as
Vicente assured them that they would all be most
welcome, they ate their supper with much enjoyment.</p>

<p>The two Senhors slept in Indian hammocks
swung between giant rubber trees, while Affonzo
curled up in a blanket and slept, as did Vicente
and Joachim, on a fragrant couch of dried grass.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
<small>ALONG THE AMAZON</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Come</span>, son," said the Senhor early next
morning. "We have a long day before us and
you must eat plenty of breakfast. That is if you
want to go with your uncle and me. If not, you
may go back home with Joachim."</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" asked Affonzo as
he smoothed down his linen suit, and combed
his hair with a pocket comb from his dapper little
uncle's case. He had washed his face in the
stream which gurgled near the hut, and that was
all the toilet he could make, which seemed odd to
him, for he was something of a dandy.</p>

<p>"We are going the rounds with Vicente to
see the rubber plantation, and then go home by
the river."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do let me go with you, I am sure my mother
would not object," cried Affonzo.</p>

<p>"I shall send Joachim home with word of
your safety to ease her mind, and as you wish it
so much, you may come with us; so eat and we
will start."</p>

<p>Senhor Dias was a rubber exporter. From
his plantation near Para went out huge
balls of the rubber, solid, tough and brown. It
is very interesting to watch the process of obtaining
this from the milk-white sap of the rubber
trees.</p>

<p>"Well, Vicente, shall we start now," said the
Senhor when they had breakfasted.</p>

<p>"When the Senhor is ready," said Vicente.</p>

<p>The Indian lived by himself all the year
around in his little hut. All along the Amazon
these cabins may be found, hidden in the woods,
and in each one dwells only a single Indian. It
is a lonely and dangerous life, the climate is unhealthful,
the swampy lands of the river valley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
where the rubber trees grow are low and
malarious, and the <i>syringuero</i> has often to wade
knee deep in mud, and work all day in wet clothing.</p>

<p>The Indians are trustworthy workers and
many of them earn a good living. Old Vicente
had worked there so long that he would not
have known how to act anywhere else, but he
was glad to have company on his lonely rounds.
So he smiled at Affonzo as the boy skipped
along, gathering one gorgeous flower after
another, as merry as the sunshine after the rain.</p>

<p>"You'd better walk a little more slowly, and
save your strength for the day's tramp," said
his father. "You'll be tired by night."</p>

<p>Vicente guided them down a well-worn path
through the marsh land. On each side were
splendid trees, the rubber tree growing as high
as seventy feet. The trunk, smooth and round,
was covered with light-coloured bark, the
leaves, oval and about a foot long, hanging in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
clusters of three. The fruit grows in clusters
also, and consists of a small black nut which the
natives like very much. Affonzo picked one
up and tasted it, but made a very wry face as
it was quite bitter.</p>

<p>Selecting a fine tree, Vicente made a deep cut
in the bark with his hatchet. Below it, by means
of some damp clay, he fastened an earthen cup,
into which the cream-coloured sap flowed slowly.</p>

<p>"By to-morrow the cup will be full," he said.
"And I will come again. Now we will find
another."</p>

<p>The next tree was half a mile away and it had
frequently been tapped before, for a row of incisions
girdled it. Vicente emptied the cups attached
to these into a large pail which he carried,
and made a new gash higher up.</p>

<p>"Do let me tap just one tree," said Affonzo,
and Vicente allowed him to do so and helped
him fasten on one of the cups to catch the sap.
Affonzo was delighted, and tramped along gaily,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
although his short legs found it difficult to keep
up with the long strides of his father and
uncle.</p>

<p>At last Vicente finished his rounds, and said,
as he showed the Senhor his brimming pail,
"This is all to-day. Does the Senhor wish to
see it cooked?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I want Affonzo to see it all, as I know
he will be interested," said Senhor Dias, and
they all followed the Indian to a little hut, such
as the one in which they had slept the night before.</p>

<p>"Let us eat first," said the Senhor. "Our
walk has given us all appetites."</p>

<p>So Vicente built a fire and roasted a <i>lagarto</i><a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
which he had killed on the way through the
forest. The delicate white flesh tasted delicious
to Affonzo, and so did the bananas and oranges
and black coffee, which Vicente made thick and
strong as it is liked in Brazil.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 352px;">
<img src="images/i0058.jpg" width="352" height="500" alt="man and boy turning spit over fire" />
<div class="caption">"THIS HE KEPT UP UNTIL THE PADDLE HAD A THICK
COATING OF RUBBER."</div>
</div>

<p>Vicente then made another fire of nuts and the
wood of the <i>motacu</i><a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> under a jug-shaped calabash,
the smoke coming out through the neck.
This smoke hastens the drying of the liquid
rubber, and makes a better quality than can be
obtained in any other way.</p>

<p>"I don't see how that stuff that looks like
cream can ever be made like rubber," said
Affonzo.</p>

<p>"Watch Vicente," said his father, "and you
will see." As he spoke, Vicente dipped a long
paddle into the liquid, and then held it over the
smoke. It quickly dried and he dipped the paddle
into the juice again, repeating the process of
drying. This he kept up until the paddle had a
thick coating of rubber, like a large, flattened
ball. Then he split the ball open along one side,
and pulled the paddle out.</p>

<p>"There now!" said the Senhor. "The rubber
is all ready to go to market. Perhaps some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
day you will bounce a ball or wear a pair of
goloshes made of this very rubber."</p>

<p>"Won't that be fine!" said Affonzo. "What
are you going to do now," he asked, as his father
rose as if to go.</p>

<p>"As soon as Vicente has finished cooking, we
will go to the river, and go home by water,"
said the Senhor. "Then you will see some of
the wood your uncle and I mean to export."</p>

<p>"That will be much better than tramping,"
said Affonzo, whose short legs began to be stiff
and sore with all the walking he had done.</p>

<p>Vicente soon finished cooking his rubber, and
put up the utensils before following Affonzo and
the two men down the path to the river.</p>

<p>"Vicente is a good Indian, isn't he?" said
Affonzo.</p>

<p>"One of the best I have ever known," said
his father. "He has worked for us for years
and has always been honest and reliable. It is
strange that he should be so hospitable and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
friendly, for his ancestors and ours were always
at war. When your grandfather was a young
man there was always fear of the natives, and at
one time there was an Indian uprising in which
many Portuguese were killed. The Indians
captured the city of Para, burned many of the
houses, and destroyed everything they couldn't
carry away with them. They held the city
over a year before the Portuguese could recapture
it."</p>

<p>"It must have been exciting to live then,"
cried Affonzo, who loved to read of wars and
battles and thought they must be interesting
things.</p>

<p>But his uncle said, "More peaceful times are
less exciting, but far pleasanter and you would
better be thankful that you live now. There
is the river! How beautiful it looks!"</p>

<p>Affonzo had often seen the Amazon, the
greatest river in the world, and had been on it
in the steamers which ply between Para and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Mañaos, but he had never seen it at this point,
and he exclaimed in wonder at its beauty. The
river was two miles wide, and in the centre was
a broad deep channel down which the water
flowed slowly. On each side of this were
stretches of shallow water, while on either bank
grew thick forests of superb trees.</p>

<p>Vicente drew a canoe from a thicket about a
sheltered cove and the little party embarked,
Vicente paddling carefully.</p>

<p>"Isn't this splendid?" cried Affonzo. "I
feel as if I were Orellaño discovering the river."</p>

<p>"Why, what do you know about him?" asked
his uncle.</p>

<p>"Oh, he was fine," said Affonzo. "He was
one of Gonzalo Pizzarro's lieutenants and
he crossed the Andes to find cinnamon trees.
He had only fifty men and they built a boat and
started down the river and had a terrible time
for days. At last they reached the mouth of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
river, and were picked up by some Spanish ships.
It told all about it in my geography."</p>

<p>"Did it tell how he named the river?" asked
Uncle Prudente. "Orellaña fell in with an
Indian tribe where the women fought side by
side with the men; you know women soldiers are
called Amazons, so he called the river 'Rio de
las Amazones.'"</p>

<p>"See those magnificent satin-wood trees," said
Senhor Dias to his brother. "Nowhere in all
the world is there such wood from which to make
fine furniture as here."</p>

<p>Then the two gentlemen fell into a talk about
business plans, and Affonzo curled up in the
canoe and watched the interesting things they
passed. It was a scene of contrast. A native
boat, one end thatched over for a house, a
hammock, in which a man lolled lazily, swung
across its deck, was passing by a large steamer
gay with flags and striped awnings. He also
saw boats laden with rubber, and many rafts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
made of great logs held together by long wooden
pins driven through them, for their long voyage
to Para.</p>

<p>As they continued down the stream, the
thatched native huts became fewer, and there
could be seen the tiled roofs of the country homes
of the wealthy. It was not long before Affonzo
saw, gleaming through the trees, the white walls
of their own Fazenda and, landing quickly, he
bade good-by to Vicente, and rushed across the
lawn to tell all his adventures to his mother and
Lola.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
<small>A VISIT TO GRANDMAMMA'S</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Fazenda of the Senhor Dias stood upon
a hill overlooking the Amazon. About it were
trees and gardens, and a small stream flowed
through the grounds toward the great river.
A pleasant little summer-house was set under
a giant palm tree and about the whole place was
an air of ease and comfort. Upon the broad,
pillared veranda and between the shady trees
hammocks were slung for the midday siesta, and
the life of the villa was cheerful and pleasant.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 354px;">
<img src="images/i0066.jpg" width="354" height="500" alt="girl sitting on grass" />
<div class="caption">"THE FAZENDA OF THE SENHOR DIAS STOOD UPON A HILL
OVERLOOKING THE AMAZON."</div>
</div>

<p>Affonzo was very tired the day after his jaunt
through the forest, and toward evening he lazily
lay in a cool hammock swinging back and forth.
His sister sat on a cushion at his feet listening in
delight to the story of his adventures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>Lola was only eight years old and she thought
her big brother of eleven quite the most wonderful
boy in the world.</p>

<p>"How I wish you could have been with me,
Lola," said Affonzo. "Of course you could not,
for girls can not go to the places that boys can.
But it was most exciting! What you would like
would be to hear Vicente. He told me a wonderful
story."</p>

<p>"Do tell it to me," said Lola, and Affonzo
retold the story of the Gilded Man, to her great
delight.</p>

<p>"Oh! what a nice story," cried Lola as he
finished. "What was the Indian's house like?"</p>

<p>"It wasn't a real house, you know," said
Affonzo. "It was a little round hut all thatched
with straw, and he had bows and arrows and
all kinds of things." Affonzo was rather vague
in his description. "The trees around were the
finest I ever saw. Oh! I am sure there is no
country in the world like ours!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>Lola smiled, and, touching the strings of her
guitar, sang softly:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Minha terra tene palmerias<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Onde canta a Sabia</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">As aves que acqui gorgeiao</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Nao gorgeiao como la.</span><br />
<br />
"Nosso ceo teni mais estrellas<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Nossos varzenes tem mais flores</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Nossos bosques tem mais vida,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Nossos vida mais amores."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></span><br />
</div>

<p>"Brava, little one," cried Uncle Prudente
who had come out from his siesta refreshed and
cool. "That was very prettily sung, little
patriot. Have you children heard the news?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>
<p>"What news, my uncle?" asked Affonzo.</p>

<p>"That you are to go home with me to-morrow
to see your grandmother."</p>

<p>"How glad I am!" cried Affonzo, and Lola
danced up and down in delight, saying,</p>

<p>"It is long since we have been in Para, and
the ride on the river will be so pleasant."</p>

<p>The next day was bright and fair and their
sail down the great river as pleasant as they
had anticipated. The air was cool and the sun
partially under a cloud, so that the heat was
not too great and the banks of the stream, with
their trees and flowers, presented views as vivid
and changing as a kaleidoscope.</p>

<p>The city of Para is one of the most important
places in Brazil. From it are sent out into the
world all the produce of the wonderful valley of
the Amazon,&mdash;woods, rubber and fruits. Its
markets are busy spots of industry, and its harbour
teems with shipping.</p>

<p>The mother of the Senhor Dias lived in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
handsome house on the edge of the town. Since
the death of her husband she had lived with her
only unmarried son, the Uncle Prudente of
whom the children were so fond. She received
the travellers warmly. Her son Martim's wife
was very dear to her, his children her idols,
especially Affonzo. He was his grandfather's
image; with his flashing black eyes, his proud
mouth, his quick, impetuous manner, he was so
like the noble old man she had so loved, that he
seemed to embody the youth of her beloved
dead.</p>

<p>"You must remain for a long visit with me,"
she said to the children. "I have asked the
children of friends to come and play with you
in the garden this afternoon. Some of your
school-mates will be here, Affonzo, and some
little folk for Lola. I hope you will have a
pleasant time."</p>

<p>"You are most kind, grandmamma," cried
both children, and when their friends came, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
all repaired to the shady garden behind the
house.</p>

<p>There were about a dozen boys and girls all
chattering at once, but in a moment's quiet Lola
said,</p>

<p>"Let us play 'Dona Sancha.' I should like
it so much and we have thirteen, just the right
number."</p>

<p>"Yes," said a little girl named Catharina.</p>

<p>"There are seven girls and six boys. One of
us must be it."</p>

<p>"Who shall be it?" they all cried merrily,
and one of the larger girls stood them in a row
and repeated,</p>

<div class='poem'>
"I am a little widow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">From the seacoast there;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I wish to find a husband</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">But I can't tell where.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Shall I marry this one? Yes.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Shall I marry that one? No.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Shall I marry this one? Yes,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">For I love him so."</span><br />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>The lot fell to a little black-eyed girl called
Constancia, who was then blindfolded and
around whom the others formed a circle by
joining hands. Then all danced around Constancia
singing,</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Madame Dona Sancha<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Covered with silver and gold,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Take away your veil then,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Your eyes we would behold."</span><br />
</div>

<p>At this Constancia uncovered her face, and
sang,</p>

<div class='poem'>
"I am the daughter of a count,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The grandchild of a king,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Behind a stone they made me hide,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">A most peculiar thing."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Then the others sang,</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Valentin-tin-tin&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Who is married,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Who is married,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">She who is not must remain alone."</span><br />
</div>

<p>At the last words the boys and girls let go of
each other's hands and each one, including Constancia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
made a rush for a partner. Lola was the
one to be left out and she had to be blindfolded,
and take Constancia's place in the centre of the
ring. So the game went on, each girl taking her
turn in the centre as often as she failed to catch
a partner in the scramble.</p>

<p>When the children were tired of play, their
grandmother sent out Christovao, an old white-haired
negro who had once been a slave, and he
showed them many wonderful tricks of juggling.
He made flowers to bloom in their hats, money
to grow on trees, and many other queer things
to happen, and his pet monkey kept them laughing
with his queer antics. Then they all sat
down around the stone fountain and had a
delicious luncheon of <i>doces</i>,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> <i>cocada</i>,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and
sweet cakes, and Affonzo and Lola went to bed
that night quite delighted with their first day in
Para.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
<small>EN ROUTE TO RIO</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Para</span> is one of the most beautiful of Brazilian
cities, with large cool houses, and squares and
gardens gay with wonderful orchids,&mdash;purple,
crimson, gold and white.</p>

<p>The weeks spent at grandmamma's were full
of delight to Affonzo and Lola, and they enjoyed
all the pleasant happenings of life in the city.
One day in October they sat in the garden
playing with the pet monkey, a saucy little
creature with a thousand cunning tricks and
ways, almost human in his intelligence.</p>

<p>"I wonder how soon we shall go home," said
Affonzo. "I begin to weary of doing nothing."</p>

<p>"I do not know," said Lola. "But I heard
mamma say something strange about it to-day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
She and my father were talking while I was
playing with the cockatoo and mamma said,
'It will be a long trip and I should dislike to
leave them behind.' 'It would do you little
good to go with them,' said my father, and
mamma replied that the worry of leaving them
would take away all the pleasure of the trip if
they were not to accompany her; then she saw
me looking and bade my father be silent. What
trip could they mean?"</p>

<p>"I am sure I do not know, and you should
never remember a conversation not meant for
you," said Affonzo, virtuously. Then, his
curiosity getting the better of his virtue, "I
wonder where they can be intending to go!"</p>

<p>"But if I should not remember what I hear,
then you should not either," said Lola pertly,
for she did not like to have Affonzo correct
her.</p>

<p>"We are two quite different people," said
Affonzo. "I am much older than you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>"When one is old, one should behave better
than one who is young," Lola retorted.</p>

<p>"Both are quite old enough not to quarrel,"
said their mother's voice sternly, as she came up
unnoticed. "What are you quarrelling about?"</p>

<p>Both children were silent and ashamed.</p>

<p>"If you dare not tell the cause, then cease the
quarrel," said the Senhora. "And remember
that well-bred children do not dispute. Now sit
down while I tell you what is going to happen.</p>

<p>"Your father has intended for some time to
make a business trip to Rio de Janeiro, going by
boat from Para. He wishes me to go with him,
for I have not been well of late, and he thought
best to leave you two with your grandmother.
I wished you to accompany me, and some news
has just come which has caused him to give his
consent.</p>

<p>"Your Uncle Juan, who went to study
medicine in Philadelphia, married there a beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
North American lady, and has a little daughter
the age of Affonzo. She is named Maria and
she had the great misfortune to lose her mother
a few months ago. She grieves terribly and her
father is bringing her to Brazil in the hope that
among his people she will grow well and strong
again. They will reach Rio de Janeiro in a
short time, and we want to be there to see them.
Would you like to go with us on this trip?"</p>

<p>"Indeed yes, mamma!" cried both in one
breath. "When do we start?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow," she replied. "I did not tell
you before, because I feared you would too
much excite yourselves. Then too I thought
something might happen to prevent our going
and you would be disappointed."</p>

<p>"Hurrah," cried Affonzo. "We shall see
Uncle Hilario!"</p>

<p>"And I shall see my cousin Martim!" cried
Lola.</p>

<p>"Yes, we shall visit my dear brother, and you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
shall have a very happy time with two cousins
to play with.</p>

<p>"Now you must be good children and give
me a chance to pack up your clothes. No questions!"
She held up her finger playfully.
"Those you may save to ask me on ship-board.
Here is a map which shows just where we are
going, and you may trace out the course and
Affonzo can tell you about all the places from
his geography, Lola," and she left the two children
poring over the geography, their tongues
fairly clacking in their excitement.</p>

<p>The <i>Icamiaba</i> is a large steamer plying from
Mañaos to Rio, and by noon the next day the
little party of four were safely embarked and
the steamer made its way out of the beautiful
harbour. The long voyage was begun, but to
Affonzo and Lola it was not tedious, for, the
only children on board, they soon became pets
with all and were in a fair way to being spoiled
with attention. The second day out the steamer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
made its first stop at Pernambuco on the easternmost
point of Brazil, and the children watched
the entrance into the harbour with great interest.</p>

<p>"Pernambuco is called the Venice of America,"
said their father. "You know Venice is an
Italian city built on islands, with waterways instead
of streets, and here there are so many
canals and arms of water reaching in from the
sea that Pernambuco is called the Venice of
America."</p>

<p>"What a lot of steamers there are!" exclaimed
Affonzo as they approached the reef
which protects the harbour. This reef runs
along the Brazilian coast for hundreds of miles,
forming a natural breakwater, sometimes twelve
feet above high tide.</p>

<p>"N-I-L-E," spelled Affonzo as they passed
a huge steamer anchored outside the harbour.
"What kind of a boat is that?"</p>

<p>"English," said his father. "The English
run a line of steamers from Southampton to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Lisbon, and thence to Rio Janeiro. These boats
carry a thousand passengers, and are so large
that they cannot go through the cut in the breakwater."</p>

<p>"Oh, papa! What a queer building! What
is it?" asked Lola, as they passed an odd-looking
fort on the rocks.</p>

<p>"That is a relic of Dutch days in Brazil,"
said the Senhor. "You know the Dutch once
laid claim to all this part of the country."</p>

<p>"Did they?" asked Lola in surprise. "How
did they get here and what became of them?"</p>

<p>"It is a long story, little one, but quite an interesting
one," said her father. "You know
Brazil was discovered by a Portuguese, Pedro
Alvarez Cabral, who sailed into the Bay of
Porto Seguro at Bahia, April 25, 1500, and
took possession of the land in the name of the
Portuguese crown, naming it Vera Cruz. The
Spaniards had made discoveries in the north of
South America, the English and French had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
come in along the Amazon and within the next
few years the Dutch entered the river and built
forts on the Xingu. Then came a long struggle
between the Dutch and the Portuguese as to
who should possess the land. In 1624, a Dutch
admiral took possession of Bahia, but a handful
of Portuguese recaptured the place the next
year; then came a succession of battles, first the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Dutch being victorious, then the Portuguese. At
last the Dutch sent Prince Maurice of Nassau as
Governor General of their possessions in Brazil,
but he returned to Holland in 1644 and from
that time on the Portuguese were successful.
They laid siege to Pernambuco (then called
Recife) and blockaded the port with sea forces
while the land army assaulted it on the other
side. The Dutch surrendered in 1654 and
Brazil became a Portuguese colony."</p>

<p>"Then I suppose everything was peaceful,"
said Affonzo, but his father laughed and said,</p>

<p>"There has not been much peace in Brazil
since the Portuguese first discovered it. After
the foreigners left, the Indians remained unconquered,
and the Portuguese sent many expeditions
against the natives in the interior. Many
adventurers went on these expeditions, and they
were called Bandierantes.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> They treated the
Indians cruelly and enslaved many, although the
Pope had forbidden making slaves of the
Indians.</p>

<p>"Another fight which took place near here
was with negro slaves. Some of them escaped
and fled to the forest of Palmeiras, in the
Province of Alagoas. Here they maintained a
colony for sixty years and were only subdued in
1697. Some of their chiefs leaped from a high
rock into the sea rather than be captured."</p>

<p>"How did they get slaves in our country?"
asked Lola.</p>

<p>"That's a rather big subject for such a little
girl," said her father. "The early settlers could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
not get any one to work for them, so they
brought black people from Africa, as did most
of the Southern countries. One good thing was
that here slavery was abolished without a drop
of blood being shed, while in North America
they had a terrible war.</p>

<p>"Now we are entering the harbour, Affonzo.
See how many ships! In one year there were
one thousand one hundred and eighty-one ships
here! They come from all parts of the world,
laden with all manner of things, but they nearly
all go away freighted with sugar. There are
thousands of tons of it exported every year. The
boat will stop here some hours, so we will go
ashore and drive about the city."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, papa," cried the children,
and their mother added, "It will be a pleasant
change from the ship."</p>

<p>So the four went ashore and drove about the
cheerful city, with its gaily painted houses, passing
one public building glazed in yellow and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
green tiles, another in imitation pink marble
trimmed in sky blue. Crossing a long bridge,
they saw magnificent gardens with brilliant
flowering plants, and the fine fruit-market where
they purchased the luscious Pernambuco <i>abacoxi</i>
the finest-flavoured pineapple in the world.</p>

<p>"It is a very fine city," said Affonzo as they
returned to the steamer.</p>

<p>"But not as handsome as Para," said Lola.
"That's the prettiest city in all Brazil," and her
father laughed.</p>

<p>When they steamed into Bahia two days later
just at twilight, she still insisted that Para was
the most beautiful place in the world, but Affonzo
was delighted with Bahia.</p>

<p>"Capt. Diego Alvarez was one of the early
explorers here," said the Senhor, as they sat
upon the deck in the moonlight, watching the
crescent of lights which rise from the harbour
toward heaven, for the main portion of Bahia is
built upon a high bluff overlooking the river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"He was captured by the Indians and was
about to be killed, when the chief's daughter
threw herself in front of him and saved his life.
Alvarez fell in love with her and married her,
taking her with him to France, where she was
honoured and cared for all her life. Some of
the best families in Bahia boast that she is their
ancestor."</p>

<p>"What are sent out from here?" asked Affonzo.</p>

<p>"Thousands and thousands of cocoanuts, for
one thing," said the Senhor. "It is a fortune
for a family to have a cocoa plantation, for the
trees produce from fifty to eighty years, and
need little attention after the first year or two.
They are very easy to raise. After planting, the
weeds are kept away from the trees, and during
the first year, banana plants are grown between
the rows to shade the young trees. The fourth
year the first crop is gathered and the trees produce
two hundred clusters of fruit with thirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
or forty nuts each. People net about sixty thousand
dollars a year from a plantation of fifty
thousand trees."</p>

<p>"It must pay to raise cocoanuts at that rate,"
said Affonzo. "Does <i>manaioca</i> pay as well?"</p>

<p>"Not quite, but it is about as easy to raise.
Everyone has to have <i>manaioca</i>. The rich
use if for puddings and desserts in the form of
tapioca, while the poor people use the <i>fariulia
de manaioca</i><a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> as their chief food. It also
makes good starch, for the roots ground up
in water deposit their starch as a fine white
powder.</p>

<p>"A farm of twelve acres belonging to a friend
of mine and planted with forty thousand plants
produces eighty thousand pounds of tapioca,
which at the lowest price brings two thousand
four hundred and twenty-five dollars."</p>

<p>"The children are growing to be regular little
encyclopedias," said the Senhora. "They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
must go to bed now, or I am afraid their brains
will burst with so much knowledge."</p>

<p>"Not much danger of that," laughed the
Senhor. "Most of it goes in at one ear and
comes out the other," but Lola and Affonzo exclaimed
indignantly, "Oh, no, papa, indeed it
does not."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
<small>IN THE CAPITAL</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">A week</span> after they had left home, the children
saw for the first time the harbour of Rio
de Janeiro, the <i>Icamiaba</i> entering the beautiful
bay between the Sugar Loaf Mountain and the
Fortress of Santa Cruz, in all the glory of a
Brazilian sunset.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 351px;">
<img src="images/i0090.jpg" width="351" height="500" alt="parents and two children on deck of ship" />
<div class="caption">"THE CHILDREN SAW FOR THE FIRST TIME THE HARBOUR
OF RIO DE JANEIRO."</div>
</div>

<p>At the left was the curious mountain called
<i>Seria dos Orgaos</i>, so named from its resemblance
to a church organ. Charming islets dotted the
bay, and orange trees, bananas, always green
and loaded with fruit, and flowers everywhere
met the eye.</p>

<p>Mountains seemed to rise from the sea; the
cliffs are nearly perpendicular with scarce a yard
of greensward at the water's edge, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
guard jealously the most beautiful harbour in
the world. Scarcely two ships can enter between
the islands marking the entrance of the bay,
which is so narrow that the discoverer thought
it a river and named it "Rio." Within, however,
the sheet of water widens until it is a
glorious inner sea, called by the Indians,
"Nictheroy"&mdash;Hidden Waters.</p>

<p>The houses of the city, walled in stucco, are
of a deep canary yellow with roofs tiled in deep
red, turning to fire beneath the sun's departing
rays.</p>

<p>"How beautiful it is," said the Senhora. "It
seems to me my old home never looked so fair!"</p>

<p>"It is one of the most beautiful places in the
world," said her husband. "See those large
buildings, children. That is the Sailors' Hospital
on Ilha da Governador,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> which was once
used as a hunting preserve by the royal family.
It is a beautiful island and many strange things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
have happened there. One was the death of the
founder of the city, Estacio de Sa. He was a
famous Indian fighter, and here received a fatal
wound from an arrow."</p>

<p>"Something seems to have happened everywhere
in Brazil," said Lola. "How near we
are to land."</p>

<p>"Yes," cried her mother. "And there is
your uncle waving his hat upon the wharf.
Martim is with him! He sees us! Wave to
him, daughter!" and the usually calm Senhora,
flushed and excited, waved her handkerchief,
smiling happily.</p>

<p>"I have not seen you look so gay for many
months," said her husband, and she replied, "It
is so long since I have seen my dear old home
and my own people!"</p>

<p>Soon the ship was made fast, and the children
stepped off the gang plank to be greeted warmly
by the uncle whom they had not seen since Lola<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
was a baby, and the cousin whom they had never
seen before.</p>

<p>"Your Aunt Luiza and Maria are anxiously
awaiting you at home," he said. "Here is the
carriage, so we will hasten."</p>

<p>"Drive through the Street do Ouvidor, papa,
will you not?" asked Martim. "It is so gay
with the French shops, my cousins will enjoy
it."</p>

<p>Martim was a handsome boy of twelve, with
a bright, pleasant face, an only child, for the
Senhor and Senhora Lopez had lost all their
other children in an epidemic of yellow fever
some years before.</p>

<p>"What are those men doing with long poles
over their shoulders," asked Lola, pointing to
several men who carried bamboo rods with
baskets hung at the ends.</p>

<p>"They are fish and vegetable vendors,"
Martim replied. "Some of those baskets weigh
over a hundred pounds. Those other men with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the gaily-painted tin trunks on their backs peddle
clothing."</p>

<p>"They make a lot of noise," said Affonzo.</p>

<p>"Yes, they warn people they are coming by
clapping together two pieces of wood fastened
to their hands by a leather strap," said his
cousin.</p>

<p>"Oh! What a beautiful statue!" cried Lola.</p>

<p>"That is the Emperor Dom Pedro I," said
her uncle. "It was made by a noted French
sculptor and represents the Emperor shouting
the Brazilian watch word 'Independencia ou
morte.'<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Here we are at home!" as the carriage
turned into a broad street on either side of
which were old fashioned houses with broad
verandas and red and white blinds. "There is
Aunt Luiza waiting to welcome you!"</p>

<p>The children jumped out of the carriage and
ran to meet their aunt, who kissed them warmly
and drew forward a tall girl of ten, who looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
pale and sad. Her hair was very light, her eyes
deep blue, and she was a great contrast to black-eyed,
brown-cheeked Lola.</p>

<p>"This is Maria, your North American
cousin," said their aunt, and Lola kissed her
warmly on either cheek.</p>

<p>"We are so glad to have you come," she said.
"And my mother is going to take you home
with us for a nice long visit. I have always
wanted a sister, so let us play we are sisters."</p>

<p>Maria kissed her and smiled, while Aunt
Luiza said, "Come, children, it is very late;
dinner is waiting and then all you little folk must
get to bed early so you will be ready for to-morrow.
There are ever so many things for
you to see."</p>

<p>Early next day the four cousins set out for a
morning's sight-seeing, accompanied by their
Uncle Hilario. The Senhor Lopez was one of
those rare men who are really fond of children,
and he enjoyed their society.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Most of the streets of the city have no curbing,
and the children had to be careful lest they
be run down by passing carriages.</p>

<p>Their uncle decided first to take them to the
famous Botanical Gardens and as they entered
the main gateway, they saw the avenue of fine
royal palms.</p>

<p>"The avenue is almost half a mile long," said
the Senhor. "And the trees are a hundred feet
high."</p>

<p>"Aren't they fine," said Affonzo. "They
are the tallest palms I ever saw."</p>

<p>"They meet together at the top and form a
regular archway the whole length of the walk,"
said Martim.</p>

<p>"What is that very high mountain?" asked
Lola.</p>

<p>"That is the Corcovado, and some day we
shall go over there and ascend it," said Martim.
"We shall have to start very early in the
morning, for it is a long trip."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here comes Doctor Barbosa, papa," said
Martim. "I wonder if he will go around the
gardens with us."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he will, if he is not too busy. If
he does, he can tell you all about the trees and
flowers for he has explored the country along
the Amazon and knows all about the Brazilian
flora."</p>

<p>As the Senhor spoke, Doctor Barbosa came up
smiling, for he and Senhor Lopez were old
friends.</p>

<p>"You have quite a bevy of little folk with
you to-day," he said pleasantly.</p>

<p>"This is my nephew, Affonzo Diaz, Doctor
Barbosa," said the Senhor. "And these girls
are my nieces, Charlotta and Maria. Of course
you know Martim."</p>

<p>"I am very glad to see you all," said the
doctor with a smile.</p>

<p>"This is the first visit of Affonzo and his
sister to our city," said Senhor Lopez.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>"Indeed," replied the doctor. "I really
think then that you should let me help show
them around the gardens. I have a few
moments of leisure just now, that I will be glad
to devote to you."</p>

<p>"That will be delightful," said the Senhor.
"You know so much about this place and I so
little that I am sure the children will much
prefer you as a guide." Bowing in appreciation
of the compliment, the doctor led the party
down the avenue.</p>

<p>"These gardens," he said, pointing down
across the avenue, "as you see, are on the border
of a large sheet of water. That is called the
Lagoa de Rodrigo Freitas, and is separated
from the sea only by a narrow strip of sand."</p>

<p>"What are those crooked, twisted trees,"
asked Lola, as they passed into another long
avenue.</p>

<p>"They are mangoes. They are not very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
handsome to look at, but you know what delicious
fruit they bear."</p>

<p>"Indeed I do," said Lola.</p>

<p>"This," said the doctor, pointing to a tall
palm beside the pathway, "is a Bahia palm. It
is from trees of this kind that your brooms and
brushes at home are made."</p>

<p>Next they saw the great candelabra tree.</p>

<p>"It looks," said Maria, "as if it were already
to be lighted for church, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"See the beautiful grove of orange trees,"
said the Senhor.</p>

<p>"Oh yes," said Affonzo. "And the trees have
both fruit and blossoms on them."</p>

<p>"That is not at all uncommon with many of
our tropical fruit trees," said Doctor Barbosa.</p>

<p>"Many of the trees here," he continued, "are
useful for other purposes than fruit-bearing.
There is the cow tree over yonder. Its sap
looks like milk, and when exposed to the air is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
soon changed to glue, and from this a useful
cement is made."</p>

<p>As the party approached a little lake in the
centre of the gardens, they saw a small eight-sided
pavilion. On its top was a bust.</p>

<p>"Whose statue is that?" asked Affonzo.</p>

<p>"If you will step closer, you can read the inscription
on the tablet," said the doctor. "And
that will answer your question."</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"To the Memory of Friar Leandro do Sacramento
of the Order of Carmelites, a graduate in the
natural sciences at the University of Coimbra, first
professor of botany in the School of Medicine in
Rio, and first technical director of the Botanical
Gardens."</p></blockquote>

<p>"If I can do as much for this beautiful park
as Friar Leandro did, I shall be content," said
Doctor Barbosa.</p>

<p>"What a magnificent palm that is!" said the
Senhor Lopez, as they turned from the pavilion
and came in sight of an unusually tall tree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said the doctor, "that is a royal palm,
over one hundred and twenty-five feet high.
The seed is said to have been brought here by
a Portuguese naval officer who escaped from
prison on the Isle de France. It was planted
with great care by the regent, Dom Joao himself,
and here is the splendid result. I am sorry
that I must leave you now, but you must come
again to see the gardens."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much for all that you have
shown us," said Affonzo, and all the children
chorused, "Thank you very much."</p>

<p>"It is past noon and we ought to be at home
now," said the Senhor looking at his watch.</p>

<p>"I believe I am hungry," said Martim,
"though I hadn't thought about it before."</p>

<p>So they all went back to the house with appetites
such as the balmy air of Rio gives to
young and vigorous boys and girls.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<small>A GALA DAY IN RIO</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the fortnight which followed the four
cousins became very well acquainted with each
other. Maria soon lost her shyness, and taught
the others many new games and sports, while
they in turn taught her the Brazilian ones which
her father had played when a boy at home.</p>

<p>The little Brazilians found their North American
cousin very interesting. She was different
from them in many ways and they never tired of
hearing her tell of things in the United States.
Although admiring her father's country very
much, she was devoted to her mother's as well,
and could never be made to admit that things
were better in South America than they were in
the north.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come, children," said the Senhora Lopez
one morning, "this is the day of the inauguration.
The President himself has given your
father tickets, for they are great friends and we
must all be ready early so as to escape the
crowd."</p>

<p>"Indeed, mamma," said Martim, "I think
the crowd's the greatest fun of all. I shall never
forget the procession the day of the parade in
honour of your Senhor Root, Maria. It was one
of the finest we ever had in Rio."</p>

<p>"I wish I had seen it," said Maria. "When
our President is inaugurated we have grand processions
in Washington. My grandfather took
me to the last one, and it was splendid."</p>

<p>"Our inauguration procession is fine, too.
You will see to-day that they know how to do
things down here as well as you do," said
Martim, as they started for the reviewing-stand.</p>

<p>"I don't doubt that," said Maria pleasantly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
"But I can't quite make out why you have a
President at all. Brazil used to be an empire
and have a splendid emperor. You showed me
his statue in the park. What became of him?"</p>

<p>"The last emperor of Brazil is dead, my
child," said her uncle. "He died in Paris in
1891, some said of a broken heart, because he
had been sent away from his beloved Brazil."</p>

<p>"Why did you send him away; wasn't he a
good man?" asked Maria.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, very good, and many of the
people were very fond of him," was the reply.
"He was always interested in the people and
tried to arrange the laws for their best interests.
He was very democratic and travelled about
a great deal, keeping his eyes wide open to learn
everything which might help his people. He
even went to your United States at the time of
the Centennial in Philadelphia."</p>

<p>"If he was so good, why did they send him
away?" asked Maria puzzled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is rather hard to explain politics to little
folk," said her uncle, smiling.</p>

<p>"Some of the Brazilians wanted to have a
republic like the United States, for they thought
that country was so prosperous that they wanted
Brazil to be like it.</p>

<p>"The people thought that the United States
had progressed more rapidly and was more
prosperous than Brazil and they did not see why
their own land should not be as great or greater
than any other American country. Brazil was
the only South American country which was not
a republic. I think the chief reason, however,
was that the heir to the throne was not at all
liked, and the Brazilians were afraid that he
would not be as wise a ruler as Dom Pedro had
been. Even those who most wanted a republic
were sorry to have the old emperor expelled, and
many of them cried bitterly when he went
away."</p>

<p>"I should think they might have waited until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
he died," said Maria. "If he was old he
wouldn't have lived long, and then they needn't
have had his heir whom they didn't like. I do
not think it was nice at all to send him away
when he had always been good and kind."</p>

<p>"If it had been in the United States you
would have shot him, like you do your Presidents,
wouldn't you?" asked Affonzo mischievously,
for he loved to tease his cousin.</p>

<p>"We have only had three Presidents killed
out of twenty-six," said Maria. "How many
of yours have been assassinated?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know," said Affonzo, rather
taken aback at the quickness of her retort.</p>

<p>"In the early days," said Uncle Hilario, "before
the republic was very firmly established, the
Presidents used to have to be taken from the
army so they could fight to keep their positions.
Now, however, things are quieter and we do not
have to have our ruler backed by sword and
guns."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here we are at the grand stand. The music
is just beginning to draw near. Hurrah! There
come the soldiers!" cried Affonzo. "Aren't
they fine-looking fellows!"</p>

<p>"What gorgeous uniforms they have!" cried
Lola, and Maria exclaimed,</p>

<p>"Aren't the plumed horses splendid!" And
they chattered all at once till their uncle fairly
covered his ears with his hands.</p>

<p>They had a good look at the two Presidents&mdash;President
Campos-Salles whose term of office
was just over, and Affonzo Penna who was the
new President&mdash;and returned home quite excited
with the events of the morning.</p>

<p>Next day they had planned an excursion to
the top of Corcovado, that beautiful mountain
which rises above Rio, serene and lofty, toward
the clouds, and all was excitement as the little
party started off.</p>

<p>"Think of having mamma with us!" cried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Lola. "Uncle Hilario, have you and mamma
been up the mountain before?"</p>

<p>"I should say we had," he laughed, then
turning to his sister, "Do you remember the
time we were caught in the terrible storm?"</p>

<p>"It was a terrific cloud burst, but we didn't
mind it," she said, laughing too. "In those days
climbing Corcovado was something of a feat.
There was no cog-wheel railway as there is to-day
but only a bridle-path. We had to start long
before daybreak and climb up the side of the
mountain. We had to take servants along to
carry provisions and there was always a large
party going.</p>

<p>"The time your uncle speaks of, he and I got
separated from the rest of the party going down
and we came near losing our way entirely.
There came up a terrible storm and when we
finally arrived at home an hour after the others
we were drenched to the skin, and they had sent
people out to hunt for us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is a very different thing to-day to go up
the mountain seated in a carriage, find a café at
the top, and have nothing to do but look at the
sights as we pass. They are well worth looking
at! See! There is the bay, its water as blue as
the sky, and you get a fine view of the old aqueduct."</p>

<p>"I wondered what that was," said Maria.
"It looks like the pictures I have seen of the
Campagna at Rome. Is it made of stone?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said her uncle. "It was built of stone
nearly two hundred years ago and is over four
miles long. In some places its arches are over
sixty feet high and it is as strong as when it was
built. Through it passes all the water drunk in
Rio, and is so delicious that we have a saying
'Who has drunk of the waters of Carioca can
drink no other water,' and 'When you have
drunk of the water of Carioca, you can live nowhere
else but here.'"</p>

<p>"When Rio people speak of the friends who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
have lived in Rio they say, 'He is a Cariocan.'"</p>

<p>"Then mamma is a Cariocan!" cried Lola,
and Maria added,</p>

<p>"And my father, too."</p>

<p>"It seems to almost walk across the chasm,"
said Affonzo. "Where does the water come
from?"</p>

<p>"When we reach the top of the mountain, I
will show you," said his uncle. "See those
magnificent waterfalls and cascades! The
scenery around here is as fine as any in Brazil."</p>

<p>"It is almost as nice as the White Mountains
at home," said Maria wickedly. She loved to
stir up her cousins and knew that to compare
anything with the States always provoked a discussion.
This time her remarks were met with
a storm of protest, at which she only laughed
naughtily.</p>

<p>"I don't believe you have such trees," said
Lola at last. "There are mangoes, tamarinds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
bread-fruits, bananas, cocoa trees, oranges and
palms all growing together. Aren't they splendid?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," said Maria. "And the
flowers are simply gorgeous. Those trees with
the flowering vine all draped around them and
hanging down in long racemes are as beautiful
as anything I ever saw."</p>

<p>"Here we are at the end of the railway," said
Martim. "Now for a climb."</p>

<p>It was but a short distance to the top, and the
children hurried along, followed more slowly by
their elders.</p>

<p>"Here we are at last," said the Senhor as they
reached the top. "Now you can see seventy
miles, for there is Organ Mount fifty miles away,
and yonder is Cape Frio, which is seventy miles
away."</p>

<p>"Among the mountain peaks there lies the
sea of gold," said Uncle Hilario. "There is a
tale told that in the early Portuguese days in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Brazil a murderer, who had been condemned to
death, escaped from prison and fled to the hills.
He wandered about, fed only by the bounty of
the forest and at last he discovered the Lake of
Gold. From its shining sands he made a
fortune, and returned in two years to Rio to buy
his pardon."</p>

<p>"The Lake of Gold," said Affonzo. "I wonder
if that is where the Gilded Man washed himself."</p>

<p>"Who was the Gilded Man?" asked Maria.</p>

<p>"It's an Indian story Vicente told me," said
Affonzo.</p>

<p>"Do tell it to me," she said, and he told her
the quaint tale with which she was delighted.</p>

<p>They lunched in picnic fashion on the grass
and had a merry time, resting afterwards while
the Senhora and Uncle Hilario told them stories
of old days in Brazil. At last it came time to return
and the two boys, after whispering together
went to their uncle with a request.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"May we not walk down?" Martim asked.
"We won't get lost and we want to do what you
and mother did."</p>

<p>"Oh, do let us!" cried Maria, who always
wanted to do every thing the boys did, but the
Senhora shook her head. At last it was arranged
that Uncle Hilario should walk down with the
boys, while the girls went discreetly home in the
train with the Senhora. The boys were jubilant.</p>

<p>"See the ships, uncle," cried Affonzo as they
looked across the bay to the broad Atlantic.
"They are just over the horizon line. What's
that puff of smoke for?" as a puff came from
a ship nearing the harbour.</p>

<p>"Watch the fort," said the Senhor, and there
another puff was seen. "Eyes are better than
ears at this range. That was a salute from the
ship answered by the guns from the fort. We
can see the smoke, but cannot hear the report.</p>

<p>"Here is the source of Carioca. The name
is from an Indian word, Kaa-ry-og, and means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
'the house of the streams from the woods.' See
how the stream is shaded by these giant trees?
That is what makes it so cold. The water flows
amidst all manner of sweet-smelling aromatic
plants, and goes into an aqueduct full of pleasant
scents. It is said to have some medicinal
qualities."</p>

<p>"It is nice enough here to cure any sickness,"
said Martim, and they went slowly on down
the mountain, following the same bridle-path
which their uncle had followed so many years
before, reaching home without any accident,
tired but delighted with the tramp.</p>

<small>THE COFFEE PLANTATION</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Senhor Lopez' business was to export
coffee, as that of his brother-in-law was to export
rubber. He had a large coffee <i>fazenda</i> in Sao
Paulo, the province of Brazil most devoted to
coffee raising, and he often went there to inspect
the plantation. He suggested therefore
that his wife, his sister, and the children should
spend a week with him at the <i>fazenda</i>, and the
two mothers decided to do so, knowing how
much pleasure it would give the little folk. It
was an all day's ride to Sao Paulo, but there was
so much to see as the train moved over the plains,
across rivers and through forests and hills, that
the children did not find it tiresome, and were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
very bright and gay as, just at sunset, they
neared Sao Paulo.</p>

<p>"This is one of the finest cities of Brazil,"
said their uncle. "Ten years ago it was not a
large place but now it has three hundred thousand
people, many beautiful buildings, electric
lights and trolley cars. It has also some very
good schools and colleges, and students come
here from all parts of the country. Perhaps
Affonzo will go to college here some day."</p>

<p>"It seems a good ways from home," said the
boy. "But uncle," he added, as they passed a
crowd of queer looking people in the station,
"what a lot of foreigners there are here!"</p>

<p>"Yes, more than in any other Brazilian city.
A number of Italians work in the mills and on
the farms, and the Germans are on the coffee
plantations.</p>

<p>"To-night we will rest, and to-morrow morning
we will see Sao Paulo, and in the afternoon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
go to the <i>fazenda</i>," said the Senhor, as they
reached the hotel.</p>

<p>The next day they had a pleasant drive
through the city and saw many interesting
things.</p>

<p>"Mackenzie College is one of the best seats
of learning in Brazil," said the uncle. "It is
on the plan of the North American colleges,
with kindergarten, primary grades and grammar
school. There is also a normal school and a
manual training shop."</p>

<p>"You see, you have to copy us," said Maria
with a laugh. "All the schools in the States are
good. You ought to live there."</p>

<p>Martim made a wry face.</p>

<p>"Maybe they are," he said, "but I don't believe
I'd care to live in the States just on account
of the schools when I can live here, and have a
school just as good."</p>

<p>"Children!" said Martim's mother, but his
father hastily interposed,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mackenzie College is named for Mr. John
G. Mackenzie, of New York City, who gave a
large sum of money to build it. But here we are
at the Garden of Light. Now you may get out
of the carriage and rest yourselves by running
about these magnificent alleys of trees, seeing
the lakes and fountains."</p>

<p>"Maria and Martim do not get along as well
as the little girl and Affonzo," he said to his
wife, as soon as the children were out of sight.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter," she said serenely. "It
does not hurt either of them to argue if it
doesn't go too far. Children are far better for
not being noticed. Affonzo gets along better
with his cousin because he has Lola to quarrel
with; Martim grows selfish from being too much
alone." She sighed and her husband's face
clouded as he thought of the children they had
lost.</p>

<p>"We will keep Maria with us if the father is
willing, as long as she is in Brazil."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"Better still, let both Maria and Martim
return home with us," said the Senhora Dias.
"Then all four young folk will learn to accommodate
themselves to each other."</p>

<p>"That is an excellent plan, and it is kind in
you to suggest it," said the Senhora Lopez, and
her husband added,</p>

<p>"We shall try to arrange it that way."</p>

<p>"Come, children," he called a few minutes
later. "We must return for lunch now as we
drive to the <i>fazenda</i> afterwards. Do you know
what we old folk have been planning?"</p>

<p>"No, papa, what is it?" asked Martim.</p>

<p>"Something pleasant, I am sure," said Lola.
"For you are the dearest uncle in the world."</p>

<p>"Thank you, little flatterer," he pinched her
cheek playfully. "It is that you four cousins
are all to return to Para for the winter."</p>

<p>"Oh, delightful," cried Lola.</p>

<p>"How nice!" Maria said, and the boys
seemed equally pleased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>The afternoon air was clear and bracing, and
the children were in high spirits as the party
drove to the <i>fazenda</i>.</p>

<p>The road wound through a beautiful country,
past vineyards, and tea and coffee plantations,
for Sao Paulo is one of the most productive
provinces of Brazil. As they passed row after
row of small trees Lola said,</p>

<p>"What pretty, glossy leaves those trees
have!"</p>

<p>"Those are coffee trees," said Martim.
"They grow about twelve feet tall."</p>

<p>"But where are the brown berries," asked
Maria. "Are they all picked?"</p>

<p>Martim laughed.</p>

<p>"It's easy to see that you've never seen coffee
growing," he said. "Did you think you could
go and pick the browned berries and stew a pot
of coffee?"</p>

<p>"No," said Maria demurely, "because we
don't 'stew' coffee where I live."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Everybody laughed at this passage-at-arms
between the two children, and Senhor Lopez
said,</p>

<p>"We are beginning to see trees belonging to
our plantation now. It is three miles square
and we have just reached the edge of the land.
The house is still three miles away."</p>

<p>"How does the coffee grow, Uncle Hilario?"
asked Maria.</p>

<p>"Do you see the cluster of green pods on the
trees, my dear? Well, seeds are within the pods,
and when they are ripened must be dried, roasted
and ground before they are ready for your coffee-pot.
Later in the season the fruit turns bright
red in colour, and makes a vivid contrast to the
foliage of the trees, which is green the year
around."</p>

<p>"Are the trees planted, or do they grow wild
like our rubber trees?" asked Affonzo.</p>

<p>"They are planted in rows and sometimes
grow as high as twenty-five feet. Usually they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
are between ten and fifteen feet high when they
first bear fruit," said the Senhor. "It takes
from three to five years for them to bear."</p>

<p>"When is the harvest time?" asked Maria.</p>

<p>"We have two crops so there are two
harvests, one in February and one in August.
Sometimes you see fruit and flowers on the same
tree at the same time. The blossoms grow in
little white bunches and are very fragrant."</p>

<p>"I should think it would take a lot of people
to pick all this coffee," said Affonzo.</p>

<p>"It does. If you were to be here next February
you would see hundreds of negroes and
Italians, men, women, and children, busy up and
down these long rows. Many of them live in
those little houses," he said, pointing to a street
lined with small wooden huts crowded close together.
About the houses were scores of small,
dark-skinned children at play.</p>

<p>"At the present time," said the Senhor, "the
men and women are at work in the sheds and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
ware-houses making the coffee ready for market.
We shall ship thousands of pounds next month.
To-morrow I will take you about and show
you what we have to do. I wish you might have
been here during the harvest season. It is very
interesting to watch the pickers with the huge
baskets strapped to their shoulders. There is
great rivalry among them to see who can be the
fastest picker on the place."</p>

<p>Before they reached the <i>fazenda</i> their carriage
passed through two gates which closed
after them with a spring, and the Senhor said,</p>

<p>"The <i>fazenda</i> factory is always enclosed by
one and sometimes two fences, for the cattle
graze loose with only a pickaninny or the
<i>madrinla</i><a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> to watch them."</p>

<p>"It looks like a fortress," said Maria.</p>

<p>"Yes, and some <i>fazendas</i> are called 'fortaleza'
for that very reason," said her uncle.</p>

<p>"It is really very much like the old fortresses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
of feudal times, within the walls of which went
on all manner of things. Inside the <i>fazenda</i>
palisades there are the houses of the labourers,
apothecary's shop, hospital, ware-houses, and
<i>terrerios</i>,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> besides the house of the owner."</p>

<p>"Why are there so few trees?" asked Lola.</p>

<p>"Nearly all the trees are cut down to make
pasture lands and only a few shade trees are
left, such as those fine palms. Here we are at
the house. When you are rested I will take you
about and show you how the coffee is made ready
for market."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />
<small>A TREAT IN PROSPECT</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> week at the <i>fazenda</i> was a time of pleasant
rest to the elders and full of delight to the
children. They rode the horses and saw the
cows milked and fed the pigs. These last were
always taken very good care of by the <i>fazendeiro</i>,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
for they afford the principal food for all
on the plantation.</p>

<p>There was very little in regard to coffee-raising
that the children did not learn, for their inquisitive
little noses were poked into every shed
and room to see what was going on. Their
Uncle Hilario went with them one day and explained
it all fully while they listened eagerly.</p>

<p>"First the coffee goes to this large shed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
is dumped into the great vat," he said. "The
iron thing in the centre of the vat is the pulping
machine. You see it is round like a cylinder and
covered with teeth, and there are holes in the
bottom. The teeth are covered on one side with
a curved sheet of metal. When the cylinder revolves,
water is turned into the vat, and as it
flows through, the seeds are carried through the
holes in the cylinder into tanks where the remaining
matter is washed away.</p>

<p>"Then they go to the drying terrace," he
said as they left the building and went toward a
large piece of ground exposed to the blazing
sun and covered with cement. "Here it is.
After the pulp has been removed from the seeds
there is left a thin skin. The seeds are spread
in thin layers upon the ground and left to dry
thoroughly in the sun, while workmen constantly
turn them over and over with rakes to hasten
the drying."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>"How long does it take to dry them?" asked
Martim.</p>

<p>"Several weeks," said his father. "On some
<i>fazendas</i> they use steam heat, but we like the
sun-dried coffee much the best. After the seeds
are thoroughly dried they are taken to another
building and passed through heavy rollers and
the chaff separated and blown away.</p>

<p>"Now we will go to the sorting room," and
they entered a long, low building where a number
of women and girls were working at long
tables piled with heaps of coffee berries. Men
were constantly bringing in baskets full of the
berries, which the women and girls sorted into
different grades according to their quality.</p>

<p>"How fast their fingers fly," said Maria.
"I don't see how they do it."</p>

<p>"They have done it so often and practice
makes perfect," said her uncle. "As they sort
the seeds they put them in sacks and the men
carry them to another ware-house, where they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
are packed in sacks and weighed ready to be
shipped."</p>

<p>"Uncle, what are those girls doing who are
flying about everywhere with sieves in their
hands?" asked Lola.</p>

<p>"They gather up all the berries which the
men scatter as they carry the coffee about," he
answered. "You see we do not want to waste
anything.</p>

<p>"Do you see those wagons being loaded?
The coffee in those sacks is ready to go to Sao
Paulo, and thence to Santos to be shipped to
North America. Our coffee goes to every part
of the world, for the coffee of the <i>Fazenda
Esperança</i> is considered especially good.</p>

<p>"Now you have followed the coffee berry
from the tree to the market and I hope you will
try to remember all about it, for the coffee industry
is one of the greatest in the country."</p>

<p>"It's ever so interesting, uncle," said Maria.
"And thank you for telling us about it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have enjoyed it more than you have," he
answered. "It is a pleasure to talk to such eager
little listeners.</p>

<p>"Rest yourselves now, for you must be tired
with all this tramping. I am going to the house
to see your mother about some plans for to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Do tell us, uncle," they all cried, but he only
shook his head and laughed as he went away.</p>

<p>"I shall simply <i>die</i> of curiosity if I do not
find out what uncle is planning," said Maria.</p>

<p>"I don't see what good that would do," said
Martim, "for you wouldn't be likely to either
know about it or to do it if you were dead."</p>

<p>Maria made a naughty little face at him, and
a quarrel seemed imminent when Lola, who had
gone to the house when her uncle did, came running
toward them waving her hand wildly.</p>

<p>"Oh! What do you think!" she cried as she
ran up to them. "The loveliest thing has happened."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>"What?" cried all the children at once, but
Lola was too out of breath to answer.</p>

<p>"Uncle Hilario is certainly a darling!" she
said at last. "He has prepared the loveliest
treat for us! He says that to-morrow we all
start for the Falls of Iguazu, and Maria, your
father has come and&mdash;" but she had no chance
to finish her sentence, for Martim shouted,
"The Falls of Iguazu! Hurrah!" and ran off
to the house, while Maria with a squeal of
"Daddy!" pelted after him as fast as she could
go. Lola and Affonzo looked at each other and
laughed.</p>

<p>"What's it all about, Lolita?" he asked and
she answered,</p>

<p>"Uncle Hilario told me that they had only
been awaiting Uncle Juan's arrival to make the
excursion to these wonderful falls and that we
start to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Where are the falls?" asked Affonzo.</p>

<p>"Indeed, I don't know, but it is several days'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
journey and we can go only part of the way by
train. We must take a boat and perhaps ride
upon burros. It is far in the woods, and very
few people go there."</p>

<p>"Let us go and find out all about it," said
Affonzo, and the two children hurried to the
house as the rest of the party had done.</p>

<p>There they found considerable excitement,
every one asking a thousand questions which
were not answered until the mothers placed their
fingers in their ears and demanded silence.
Maria was seated upon her father's knees, her
usually sober little face bright with happiness,
as she whispered to Lola, "He is going to
Para with us, to stay all winter, so I can be with
him and have you too!" Lola gave her hand
a loving squeeze, but said nothing, for Uncle
Hilario began to speak.</p>

<p>"The Falls of Iguazu, children, are one of
the most beautiful places in all Brazil. They
lie at the joining of the Parana and Iguazu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
rivers, at the point where the frontiers of Brazil,
Paraguay and Argentina meet. We will go by
rail to Curitaba but part of the way lies through
the mountains and will be hard to travel. The
sail down the river will be delightful. Your
mother, Martim, will stay here on the plantation,
and any one who wishes may stay with her.
Uncle Juan, Martim and I, your father and
mother, Lola, are going. Who else wants to be
in the party?"</p>

<p>"I!" cried all three children at once, and
Lola added,</p>

<p>"We'll be so good, uncle, if we can only
go!"</p>

<p>"Well, you may all go, then," said the Senhor
Lopez, "and I think it will be a delightful
trip. No&mdash;" as they all started to ask questions&mdash;"don't
ask me a thing to-day. There
will be plenty of time to talk about it on our
journey, and I have not a moment to spare, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
it takes a great deal of planning to get such a
party off."</p>

<p>"Yes, and I have all I can possibly attend to,"
said Lola's mother. "So you little folk must
amuse yourselves."</p>

<p>"I am the only one who has nothing to do,"
said Uncle Juan. "Suppose you all come out
under the palms with me, and I will try to tell
you something of the country we are going to
see." So joyfully they trooped after him and
listened spellbound to his words.</p>

<p>"The country where we are going," he said,
"is called the 'Land of the Missiones' because
it is here that the early missions were founded by
the Jesuits. These devoted men went all over
that part of Brazil trying to convert the Indians
and making settlements, some of which are still
standing after two hundred years. San Ignacio,
though deserted by the Indians, is still in existence
near Iguazu and there was once there a
prosperous Indian settlement built around a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
<i>plaza</i>, with a school, dwelling houses and a
church.</p>

<p>"The falls are magnificent, but you will have
to wait and see them before you can understand
how really beautiful they are."</p>

<p>"Not so beautiful as Niagara, father, of
course!" said Maria, and her father said,
"Some people think they are quite as fine,
daughter; but have you a chip on your shoulder
now about the States? Maria would never
admit to any North American that anything in
the States could be finer than it was down here,"
he added to the boys.</p>

<p>Martim exclaimed, "Well, she's a queer sort
of a girl! She never would let us praise anything
here, because she'd always say the States
were finer."</p>

<p>"The States were mamma's," she murmured,
and her father held her close and kissed her as he
whispered, "Little Loyalty!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />
<small>THE FALLS OF IGUAZU</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> morning dawned cool and pleasant. All
were ready for an early start and there followed
a week of delight for the children. The railway
journey over, they took their way through the
forests, over plains and across rivers. In some
the hoofs of the horses or of the sure-footed
little burros the children rode sank in the sand
which covered the land as at one time the sea
had covered it. Again, trees appeared, and at
last they reached the virgin forest where
monkeys scampered among the trees and the
cries of parrots were heard in the air, as their
brilliant plumage flashed in the sunlight.</p>

<p>At times the bridle path was so narrow that no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
two horses could have passed each other had
they met.</p>

<p>Convolvulus and creeping plants encircled the
huge trees, and, swaying in the breeze, long vines
swung gracefully down, often forming natural
swings in which the children delighted. At night
the party camped in tents, the negro servants
cooking wonderful meals from the game shot
during the day.</p>

<p>The days were not too hot and at night a fire
was often necessary, for when the <i>terral</i><a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> did not
blow from the land the <i>veracao</i><a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> wafted zephyrs
from the ocean. The air was laden with the
subtle perfume of the magnolia and orange blossom,
and life seemed an existence of pleasure
and joy.</p>

<p>The Senhor's trip had not been all for
pleasure. It was his intention to increase his
export trade in native woods, and he had made
the journey through the forest to see whether it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
would be possible to get wood to the sea, were
he to buy a tract of land in this region. The
children, however, knew nothing about this.
They were occupied with having a good time,
and they were having it.</p>

<p>Martim and Affonzo hunted and fished, while
the girls vied with each other in weaving rush
baskets and in making flower-chains of the wonderful
flowers which grew everywhere along the
road, in gorgeous beauty.</p>

<p>As they neared Iguazu, the roar of the cataract
could be heard for miles, and when they finally
saw the falls, beyond the first surprised "Oh!"
which broke from all, there was nothing said.</p>

<p>The river Iguazu makes a sharp bend above
the falls and a portion of it rushes around the
inner bank and falls into a gorge two hundred
and ten feet deep; the remainder of the current,
however, sweeps over the edge of a cliff and
making two great leaps of a hundred feet falls
in a huge half moon three thousand feet wide.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
All about was the most charming Brazilian
scenery, with trees over one hundred feet high
overgrown with tropical vines, and above all
shone the deep blue of the tropical sky.</p>

<p>"Well, little Yankee, how about Niagara
now?" asked Martim teasingly.</p>

<p>"There's only one Niagara," said Maria
sturdily, and her father added,</p>

<p>"Niagara and Iguazu cannot be compared.
The one is surrounded by cultivated parks and
thriving modern cities, the other with the abandon
of nature. Niagara makes a single leap
over a precipice one hundred and eighty feet
high, while Iguazu is broken in fall but far
wider. Either one is a possession for any country
to be proud of and neither one is worth a
single quarrel.</p>

<p>"We are to camp here for some days. I hope
you little folk will have a nice time and I am
not going to issue a lot of commands to spoil
your pleasure. Only one thing is forbidden; you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
must never go away from camp without one of
the servants unless you are with one of us grown
people. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," they all said, and he added,</p>

<p>"I am sure I can trust you. The forest is full
of all manner of animals and creeping things,
and it would be very easy to lose your way, so
that we could never find you again. Now, have
all the fun you can for our week here will soon be
over."</p>

<p>What orgies of delight followed! The girls
bathed in the stream and ran wild in the sunshine,
happy and tanned, going into the forest
with the boys, except when they were going hunting.</p>

<p>Several days before their return home, the
whole party went up to San Ignacio to see the
ruins of the old mission in the heart of the
woods. Huge trees mark the site of the flourishing
town, where once were cheerful homes which
only eighty years ago were burned. So well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
were these dwellings built that the ruins are in
excellent preservation, and the children played
hide-and-seek in and out of the deserted walls,
their merry laughter waking the echoes of the
past. Maria had taught them the game she
called 'High Spy,' and they enjoyed it greatly,
she most of all.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i0142.jpg" width="350" height="500" alt="girl standing by large tree" />
<div class="caption">"'I MUST NOT BE SILLY AND CRY,' SHE SAID TO HERSELF."</div>
</div>

<p>"Now then, Martim, it's your turn to be it,"
she said. "And you can't find me!" as she sped
away to hide in some new and strange place.
Before she knew it she had gone farther into the
forest than she meant, and she did not know
how to return. She turned this way and that, but
there seemed no path. All about her the woods
hemmed her in everywhere like a great green
curtain. Then catching her foot in a swinging
vine she fell and hurt her ankle. Frightened,
she stood under a great magnolia to think.</p>

<p>"I must not be silly and cry," she said to herself.
"I can't have gone very far, and if I sit
still they'll be sure to come and find me. If I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
go on I may just get farther and farther away.
I am going to stay right here anyway, until my
ankle is better," as she seated herself quietly.</p>

<p>Maria was a brave child and old for her age,
and she sat quite still, though the tears came into
her eyes.</p>

<p>Soon she grew very drowsy and could hardly
keep awake, for the woods were full of soft,
cooing sounds and at last she dropped asleep.</p>

<p>It was almost twilight when she awoke, and
the rays of the setting sun gleamed between the
leaves. Drowsily stirring, she heard the sound
of voices, and sitting up suddenly she saw a little
Indian girl talking to a splendid cockatoo which
perched upon her hand. The parrot was chattering
in Portuguese, and his little mistress was
talking to him lovingly, but she sprang away in
fright as Maria got up from the ground.</p>

<p>"Can you show me the way to the camp?"
she asked. "I am lost."</p>

<p>"What camp? Where did you come from?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
asked the Indian. She was a little younger than
Maria, and dressed in a quaint little peasant's
costume of blue skirt and red blouse with a huge
straw hat upon her black hair.</p>

<p>Quickly Maria told her story and the little
girl said,</p>

<p>"I can take you back. You must have run
very quickly to have come so far. We must
start at once to reach the Mission before
dark."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you ever so much," said Maria.
"I am so anxious to get back, for my father will
be hunting for me."</p>

<p>"He might hunt all night and not find you,
for the forest has many paths," said the little
girl. She had a sad little face but it was very
sweet when she smiled.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" asked Maria as the
two girls trudged along through the forest, her
companion still carrying the cockatoo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Guacha</i>,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> because I have no mother," she
answered. "That is my Indian name, but I am
also called Teresa."</p>

<p>"My mother is dead, too," said Maria, and
the two little girls looked into one another's eyes
with sympathy.</p>

<p>"My father is dead, also," said Guacha.
"We were of the Mission Indians, but all my
own people died of the fever two years ago."</p>

<p>"But who do you live with?" asked Maria.
"Have you no friends at all?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I live with some of the Indians who
were my father's friends!" said Guacha, "and
Chiquita here is my good friend," and she
smiled at the bird, who chattered to her gaily
and pecked gently at her cheek. "I wish you
could go home with me!" cried Maria impulsively,
and just then she heard a shout resounding
through the forest,</p>

<p>"Maria! Maria!" sounded her father's voice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
and the two little girls hurried along faster,
Maria answering the call as loudly as she
could.</p>

<p>In a few moments they came in sight of the
camp, and Maria was caught to her father's
breast and kissed and scolded all in the same
breath, while the rest of the children gathered
around, eager with questions, all but Guacha,
who stood apart, wistful and silent. Maria did
not forget her, however, for escaping from her
father's arms, she took the little Indian girl by
the hand and said,</p>

<p>"Scold me all you want to, Daddy, though
I did not mean to run away, but be kind to
Guacha, who brought me back and who has no
father."</p>

<p>Then the little Indian was made welcome,
thanked and made much of, and the Senhora
said,</p>

<p>"You must stay all night with us, dear child,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
for it is too late for you to return home through
the forest. Will they be worried about you?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, Senhora, I will stay," she said
simply. "There is no one at all to worry about
me."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />
<small>GUACHA</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Chiquita</span> and Guacha proved a pleasant addition
to the happy circle of little folk, for, though
shy at first, the little Indian soon thawed out in
the genial atmosphere about her. Many quaint
little stories she told of Indian ways and
customs, legends of the times of the Inca conquests,
and stories of the days when her forefathers
had been Caciques of the tribe. She was
a sweet-natured little soul, and the Senhora kept
her with them until the last day of their stay.</p>

<p>The evening before they were to return to
Sao Paulo, all sat around the camp-fire, laughing,
talking, and telling stories, Guacha beside
Maria, for the two little girls had grown nearly
inseparable. The green and red cockatoo was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
perched upon Guacha's shoulder, half asleep,
but when his little mistress laughed, he chuckled
sleepily, that half amused, half contemptuous
laugh which makes a parrot seem so human.</p>

<p>"To-morrow we start toward home," said
Lola dreamily, as she sat resting her head
against her mother's knee.</p>

<p>"<i>Saudade</i>,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> little daughter?" asked her
father.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, papa, how could I be really homesick
when I am having such a delightful time
with my cousins," said Lola sweetly. "But I
should like to see grandmamma in Para and my
dear old nurse at the <i>fazenda</i>."</p>

<p>"I want to see Joachim and Vicente," said
Affonzo.</p>

<p>"I want to see mamma," said Martim. Big
boy that he was, he was not ashamed of being
devoted to his mother.</p>

<p>Maria's eyes filled with tears, and she slipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
one hand into her father's and he held it
tight.</p>

<p>The Senhora hummed lightly under her breath
the sweet Brazilian "Home Sweet Home,"<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
then the young folk took up the strain and sang
together:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Mine is the country where the palm-trees rear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Their stately heads toward the azure sky,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And where, in accents ever soft and clear,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The sabiá sings her hymn of melody;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Here, in my exile, say what warblers rare</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Can with the sabiá's notes their own compare?</span><br />
<br />
"Friendless, alone, at night, I dream of thee;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">My slumbering senses wrapped in peace and bliss</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I see the palms; the sabiá's melody</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Falls on my ears; once more I feel the kiss</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Of lips I love; I wake, the vision's gone,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The sabiá to his native woods has flown.</span><br />
<br />
"Spare me, O God, until in peace I lie<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Asleep for ever in the land I love,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Then may the sabiá carol joyfully,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Perched in the palms, my resting-place above.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">So gathering in the first-fruits of my love,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">No longer homesick, every heart-ache past,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Bearing the sheaves for which in grief I strove,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">A plenteous harvest may I reap at last."</span><br />
</div>

<p>As they finished, Maria heard from the slight
figure beside her a sigh that was almost a sob
and she turned quickly to find Guacha's eyes
filled with tears, fixed upon her.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she whispered. "Are you
ill?"</p>

<p>"Oh no," said Guacha. "But you all love
each other so dearly and I have no one to love,
only Chiquita," as the cockatoo rubbed his
fluffy head against her cheek.</p>

<p>"You have me," said Maria.</p>

<p>"But you are going away from me," she answered
mournfully.</p>

<p>"No, my child." Maria's father laid his
hand kindly upon the little Indian's dark head.
"You may come with us if you will."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, papa!" cried Maria, her face alight
with eager delight. "Will you really take
Guacha back with us?"</p>

<p>"I thought that you might like to have her
go back with us and play that she was your
sister," he said pleasantly. "Your aunt says she
will take care of you both during the rest of the
year, and the old people who have cared for
your little friend are ready to give her to us if
she wants to come. How about it, Guacha?
Will you go far off to Para and be Guacha's
sister?"</p>

<p>She looked from him to Maria, from Maria
to the Senhora, who smiled at her kindly.</p>

<p>"May I take Chiquita?" she asked. "He
hasn't a friend in all the world but me."</p>

<p>"Of course you may take your birdie, you
dear little girl," said the Senhora, "and we shall
all hope to have you very happy with us."</p>

<p>Guacha gave a contented little sigh, and
slipped her hand into Maria's.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are all so good," she said. "I could
never be anything but happy with you."</p>

<p>"It will be ever so jolly," broke out Affonzo,
the irrepressible.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Martim. "I'll have another
girl cousin to tease, but she won't treat me as
unkindly as you treat your Brazilian cousins,
Maria."</p>

<p>"Well, maybe not," laughed Maria, "but
you know Guacha is the only one of you all who
is really and truly my Little Brazilian Cousin."</p>
